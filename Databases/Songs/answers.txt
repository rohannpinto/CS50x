If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I would use the REAL data types in an equal weighted summation formula to generate their "aura". I would akin to a hash function which could take in a variety of various REAL attributes and place this person within some bucket of aura.
Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Increasing or decreasing the weights of various REAL factors might be a better way of determining the person's aura.
